## A kind and humble note: 
The code which I pushed to github initially is not indented correctly, but it is indented and formatted correctly in my code editor. I searched for that issue and came to know that github by default uses 8 tab spaces. So I changed it to 2 tab spaces in Github's settings **Settings > Appearance > Tab Size preference**. After that it is formatted and indented correctly in Github.
